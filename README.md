# Wine Quality Prediction using Random Forest Classifiers
This repository contains code for predicting the quality of wine using random forest classifiers. The dataset used for this project contains various physicochemical properties of wine, such as acidity, pH level, alcohol content, etc., along with a quality rating.

# About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of two datasets, one for red wine and another for white wine. Each dataset contains several attributes along with a quality rating provided by experts.
